# ONVIF-SIM

This folder contains a small ONVIF simulation environment. The primary pieces are:

- `CamDiscoverer/`: discovery utilities.
- `fakecamera/`: the ONVIF camera simulator with HTTP + SOAP handling and authentication.

For authentication details, start with the fake camera guide:

- [fakecamera README](fakecamera/README.md)
- [Authentication helpers (authhandler)](fakecamera/authhandler/README.md)
